[{"id":0,"title":"Introduction","content":"#\n\nSkelegit is a comprehensive toolkit for building Git interfaces and backends. It\nprovides a plugin-based architecture that allows you to connect to multiple Git\necosystems including GitHub, GitLab, and self-hosted solutions.\n\n\nWhat is Skelegit?#\n\nSkelegit consists of several key components:\n\n 1. Core SDK - Provides the foundational interfaces and plugin system\n 2. React SDK - Pre-built components for building Git interfaces\n 3. CLI Tools - Command-line interface for project management\n 4. Plugins - Connectors for different Git providers\n\n\nKey Features#\n\n\nPlugin Architecture#\n\nConnect to any Git provider through a standardized plugin interface. Skelegit\ncomes with built-in plugins for popular providers and makes it easy to create\ncustom plugins.\n\n\nReact Components#\n\nBuild beautiful Git interfaces quickly with pre-built React components for:\n\n * Repository browsing\n * Pull request management\n * File tree navigation\n * Branch switching\n * Commit history\n\n\nModern Stack#\n\nBuilt with modern technologies:\n\n * TypeScript for type safety\n * Effect for functional programming\n * React 18 for UI components\n * Vite for fast development\n * Tailwind CSS for styling\n\n\nGetting Started#\n\nThe easiest way to get started is with the CLI:\n\n\n\nThis will create a new project with all the necessary dependencies and\nconfiguration files.","routePath":"/guide/","lang":"","toc":[{"text":"What is Skelegit?","id":"what-is-skelegit","depth":2,"charIndex":229},{"text":"Key Features","id":"key-features","depth":2,"charIndex":547},{"text":"Plugin Architecture","id":"plugin-architecture","depth":3,"charIndex":563},{"text":"React Components","id":"react-components","depth":3,"charIndex":759},{"text":"Modern Stack","id":"modern-stack","depth":3,"charIndex":969},{"text":"Getting Started","id":"getting-started","depth":2,"charIndex":1173}],"domain":"","frontmatter":{},"version":""},{"id":1,"title":"Installation","content":"#\n\n\nPrerequisites#\n\n * Node.js 18 or higher\n * pnpm (recommended) or npm\n\n\nCLI Installation#\n\nInstall the Skelegit CLI globally:\n\n\n\nOr with pnpm:\n\n\n\n\nPackage Installation#\n\nIf you want to use Skelegit in an existing project:\n\n\n\nFor specific plugins:\n\n\n\n\nDevelopment Setup#\n\nTo contribute to Skelegit or run it locally:\n\n 1.
